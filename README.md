# Handwritten Digits Classification using ANN

## Overview
Welcome to the **Handwritten Digits Classification** project! This project implements an artificial neural network (ANN) model to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark in machine learning.

---

## Project Highlights ✨
- **Digit Classification**: Classifies handwritten digits using a deep neural network built with Python and Keras.
- **Dataset**: Utilizes the famous MNIST dataset, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits.
- **ANN Architecture**: Developed using a simple feedforward neural network with an optimized learning process.
- **Machine Learning Implementation**: Trained the model to recognize digits by learning patterns in the pixel data.

## Technologies Used 🔧
- **Python** 🐍
- **Keras** with **TensorFlow** 🧠
- **NumPy** 🔢
- **Matplotlib** 📈
- **Scikit-learn** 📊

## Features ⚡
- **Neural Network Model**: A fully connected neural network architecture with multiple layers (input, hidden, output).
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed (normalized, reshaped) for optimal neural network training.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: The model is trained using backpropagation and evaluated with accuracy metrics.
- **Visualization**: Includes visualizations of training accuracy, loss curves, and sample digit images.

## How It Works 🛠️
1. **Data Loading**: The MNIST dataset is loaded using Keras and split into training and test sets.
2. **Preprocessing**: The pixel values are normalized (scaled between 0 and 1) and reshaped for the ANN.
3. **Model Architecture**: A neural network with an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer for classification.
4. **Training**: The model is trained on the training data, learning patterns and optimizing weights using backpropagation.
5. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is tested on the test dataset and evaluated using accuracy metrics.
